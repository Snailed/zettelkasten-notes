Short Answers:
1. Show that a grammer G is ambiguous by exhibiting an input string with two different parse trees.
2. Rewrite the grammar G to be unambiguous, e.g., Assignment 5, Task 5.

Long Answers
3. LL(1) grammar (e.g. in LAB-9-LL1-parsing), i.e., eliminate left recursion, eliminate common prefix, compute NULLABLE, FIRST, FOLLOW sets, then compute lookahead sets, and write a recursive descent parser or a parse table (see slides today).

4. SLR grammar, construct a parse table
5. Which grammars are recognizable by a Context-Free-Grammar

How do you extend the parser into one that generates the syntax tree (see page 67 and 69)
