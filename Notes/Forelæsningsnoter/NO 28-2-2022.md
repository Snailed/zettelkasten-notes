Trust-Region Methods
1. find an approximation function
2. find the direction such that you have the minimum of the approximation function that is within the trust region
3. adjust the radius based on how well the approxmiation function approximates
4. if the new step is sufficiently better than the old step, take the step.

$\rho(p)$ is a measure for model quality. We want to find a $\Delta$ such that it prevents bad steps ($\rho < 0$) but does not shorten good steps.
