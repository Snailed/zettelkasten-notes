Inequality constraints:
	Convex polytopes can be described as $K$ linear inequalities
	Linear programs
		Objective function is linear
		All constraints are linear
	
Newton's method is hard to get numerically stable
A function is convex if its hessian is positive semi-definite.
We often want to "just get close enough" to a local minimum such that we are in its convex neighborhood.
