Microsoft reseachers say that search engines can help predict pancreatic cancer
They can identify 5-15% of cases while retaining very low false positive rates (0,00001-0,0001%). 
Lead time bias - 5 year survival rate does not tell much about mortalitity rate (just that you detect it earlier)
A consequence of the sensitivity is that from a population of 100 000 users with 10 people with undetected cancer, just as many false positives as true positives.
We need fewer misleading results!
