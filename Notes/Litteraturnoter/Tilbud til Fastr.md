1: We often utilize pretotyping as a const-efficient means to conduct experiments to validate hypotheses based on assumptions about the audience, the market, and the product.
1: end-2-end testing and declarative pipelines allows us to move forward at a fast pace, while automated verification makes every step forward a safe one.
2: Build-measure-learn cycle is designed to gurantee results of great value by being both data-driven and cost-efficient
2: Lean principles
2: An epic is a central building block. It describes a feature solving a problem for the end-user and ultimately represents value. It becomes a feature in the product. 
2: The process of grooming epics implies identification, estimation, break-down, prioritization and unambiguous description.
2: If anyone is working focused and intensely for two weeks, then they ought to be able to create visible value.
2: We **measure end-user behavior** and do a retrospective with the customer (how?)
3-4: Design workshops and pretotyping enables the customer to better assess whether they would like to invest in the actual software development.
4: Our process dictates that we evaluate your assumptions about the market before we commence any actual software development.
