# Synopse
Andrew Pole works as a statistician at Target in 2002. 
New parents are valuable customers since you can change people's shopping habits
Birth records are public, but if you can get ahead of the curve, you have a big advantage.
Target women in their second trimester
Guest-ID, internal customer primary key, used to profile customers. Includes everything like sex, marital status, age, where you live, estimated salary, whether you moved recently, what credit cards you use
> Target can buy data about your ethnicity, job history, the magazines you read, if you've ever declared bankruptcy or got divordedd, the year you bought (or lost), where you went to college, what kinds of topics you talk about online, whether you prefer certain brands of coffee, paper towels, cereal or applesauce, your political leanings, reading habits, charitable giving and the number of cars you own.

Everyone does this, but Target are the best at it.
Habits are amazingly important in our behavior

How our brains makes habits, the structure of habits and why they are important
Cure-routine-cue-routine loop

If you learn about cue-routines, you get better at responding to them in a sensible way

The febreze case - piggy back on existing habits

Andrew Pole's job was to analyze cue-routine-reward loops among shoppers (send toy ads before christmas, sunscreen and swim suits in april and so on)

Big life events make people change shopping habits

Pregant people buy lotion, vitamins, soap, cotton balls (scent-free) especially when close to their due date

They can use this to construct cue-reward loops. Give her a coupon on a friday so she makes a weekend trip, reward her with free starbucks afterward, include offers for pregnancy related products (groceries, clothes, bathing suits and so on) so she makes it a habit to go to starbucks.

How are women going to react?

The case in Minneapolis: A father comes in with coupons and is angry. Turns out his daughter is pregnant.

When target get confronted:
"We want to make the best experience"
"We comply with all laws"
"You're wrong on all accounts, publishing would mislead the public, but we won't tell you why"

Target realizes it's a PR-disaster

Aside: Losing weight, identifying cues.

Target wants it to be hidden - put the lawn mower next to the diapers

Pole was not allowed to stay in contact with Duhigg
