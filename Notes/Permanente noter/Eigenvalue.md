A scalar value $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of the $n\times n$ matrix $A$ if there is a non-zero vector $q$ such that
$$Aq = \lambda q$$

$q$ is called an [[Eigenvector]]

If a matrix is positive definite ([[Positive Definite Matrices and Positive Semi-Definite Matrices]]) as well as symmetric, then its eigenvalues are all positive real numbers.

The eigenvalues of a $n\times n$ matrix $A$ are the solutions $\lambda$ to
$$\det (A - \lambda I_n) = 0$$

A symmetric matrix can be decomposed into its eigenvalues and vectors: [[Symmetric Eigenvalue Decomposition]]
