Suppose that $\nabla^2f$ is continous in an open neighborhood of $x^*$, and that $\nabla f(x^*) = 0$ and $\nabla^2 f(x^*)$ is positive definite. Then $x^*$ is a strict local minimizer of $f$.

This is related to the [[Second order nescessary conditions]] for optimilality and the [[First order nescessary conditions for optimality]].
