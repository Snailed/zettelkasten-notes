[[Ryan, 2015 - A Review of Modern Computational Algorithms for Bayesian Optimal Design]]

A kind of [[Experimental Design]] that utilizes [[Bayes Theorem]] to incorporate [[Prior distribution]]s that can encode information from previous studies, expert elicited data or subjective beliefs from the experimenters.

Prior information is ignored when performing analysis on the data gained from these experiments.

Ryan, 2015, distinguishes between designs that have arisen from "just" encorporating probability distributions and averages on the parameters to "fully" Bayesian designs where the design criterion is a functional of the posterior distribution.
