A [[Series]] with a _Q-linear_ [[Convergence rate]] is defined like so:

Let $\{x_k\}$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that converges to $x^*$. We say that the [[Convergence]] is _Q-linear_ if there is a constant $0 < r < 1$ such that
$$\frac{||x_{k+1}-x^*||}{||x_k-x^*||}\leq r, \quad \text{for all }k\text{ sufficiently large.}$$

This looks a lot like the definition of a derivative, which is not a coincidence.
