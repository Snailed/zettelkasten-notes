The $p(A)$ in [[Bayes Theorem]]. 

Encapsulates the probability of $A$ _before_ observing $B$. 
Is picked by the model designer and is a source of bias, but can also make models more robust. 

Often picked to fit with the [[Likelihood distribution]] such that the prior is a [[Conjugate prior]]  and, together with the posterior, are [[Conjugate distributions]].

In Bayesian Statistics, the prior is used to encode knowledge about the _unknown parameters_ of the model.
