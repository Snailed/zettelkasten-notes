In [[Experimental Design]], the Design Criterion which can describe the _worth_ of choosing one design compared to another. It can be regarded as the function to optimize.

In [[Bayesian Optimal Design]] specifically, this involves designing a utility function $U(\textbf{d}, \mathbf{\theta}, \textbf{y})$ where $\mathbf{d}$ is a design from the design space $\mathbf{D}$ yielding data $\mathbf{y}$ from sample space $\mathbf{Y}$ with model paramter values $\mathbf{\theta}\in \mathbf{\Theta}$ . 
The utility function is a functional of a posterior.

A common design criterion is [[Mutual Information]], [[Mutual Information as Design Criterion]]
