[[Ryan, 2015 - A Review of Modern Computational Algorithms for Bayesian Optimal Design]] (page 1)

The goal of experimental design is to optmize the use of ressources when gathering intelligence/data in an environment where there is a variability that is not under the control of the experimenter.

One might use experimental design to:
- Control systematic error (bias)
- Reduce random variation
- Increase precision of parameter estimates (or some other measure of interest)
- Make predictions about future observations
- Discriminate between competing models

One can regard experimental design as an optimization problem, because we want to achieve these goals as fast as possible and use as few ressources as possible.

> Essentially, non-optimal designs require more resources to make inferences on the features of interest with the same (or less) level of reward that an optimal design would.

Classical experimental design uses information theory and is well suited for linear og linearised models, but a lot of modern research is focused on [[Bayesian Optimal Design]]
