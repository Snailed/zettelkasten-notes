[[Ryan, 2015 - A Review of Modern Computational Algorithms for Bayesian Optimal Design]]

A common [[Design Criterion]] is to maximise expected information gain on the model parameters $\theta$ (or on functions of $\theta$ denoted $\phi(\theta)$, due to performing the experiment at design points $\mathbf{d}$. 
In this case, the [[Mutual Information]] between $\phi(\theta)$ and the data $\textbf{y}$, conditional on the design $\mathbf{d}$., is given by

It is worth noting that $p(\mathbf{y|d})$ is hard to compute in practice
