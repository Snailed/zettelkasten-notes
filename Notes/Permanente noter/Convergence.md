A [[Series]] is defined as _converging_ if the limit as it approaches infinity is a number that exists and is not $\infty$ or $-\infty$.
$$\{s_n\}^\infty_{n=1}$$
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}s_n = c$$

A series is otherwise defined as _diverging_ if its limit does not exist or approaches $\infty$ or $-\infty$.
