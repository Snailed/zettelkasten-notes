# My questions
- Is pay per hour or fixed amount per month?
- How many hours a week? Can I work less in exam periods and more in breaks? (want to work more in the summer break for example)

# About me
- 23 years old
- Studying a Master's of Computer Science at DIKU and am on my 1. semester
- Plan on writing my thesis from February 2025
- After my Master's, I wish to pursue a PhD in Machine Learning. Therefore I do my best in school :)
- My studies mostly focus on Machine Learning and project work, have dabbled a bit in Programming Language Theory for fun
- I have worked as a software developer since 2018, but quit last summer to focus on school so I could become a researcher.
- Before I quit, I had a senior-ish role at the company even though I was also a student. I was responsible for most of the big software/architecture choices we took, and I had set up our entire Cloud Infrastructure setup. I have experience with project management, CI/CD, agile development practices, testing and frontend/backend development.
- When I don't do schoolwork, I play music with my friends, make homebrewed beer and throw dinner parties for my friends together with my girlfriend.
